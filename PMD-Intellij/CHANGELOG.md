# PMDPlugin Changelog

## [1.0.6]
### Changed
- PMD dependencies to com.ctrip.flight.mobile.pmd:pmd-java:1.0.6
- The version and the dependent pmd-java version are 
- StreamExpressionStyleRule special processing is done for Optional.get().getXXX(), and it will not be judged as a 
violation without line breaks.
- AvoidStreamExpressionInIfStmtsRule for the isPresent or get().getXXX of the stream object, such as if(Optional
.isPresent()), no violation will be determined
- AvoidUseComplexStreamExpressionInSetMethodRule Add the threshold parameter 'complexStreamLayerNum' for judging complex
 stream expressions (default threshold 1).
  - Only when the level of the stream expression exceeds the configured value will it be determined to be a complex 
 stream expression.for example: model.setHasTicket(listStream.anyMatch(...)), the level of the stream expression in 
 this scenario is only 1.
  - At the same time, the judgment of the number of lines used is also added to the entire flow expression. If the 
 number of lines used exceeds the configuration, it will also be judged as a complex flow expression.for example: the 
 conditional judgment statement in anyMatch has line breaks.
- ConditionalTooLongNeedChangeLineRule change threshold to 80.
### Added
- Add Customization Rules(see detail readme.md)
  - TernaryChangeLineRule
  - AvoidTernaryNestedTernaryRule
  - AvoidYodaConditionRule

  - AvoidGetEnumUseForStatementRule
  
## [1.0.4]
### Changed
- PMD dependencies to com.ctrip.flight.mobile.pmd:pmd-java:1.0.5
- The range of AvoidComplexConditionalRule has been increased, including bitwise OR (|), bitwise AND (&),  exclusive 
OR (^), right shift (>>>, >>), left shift (<<), not (!, ~)
- GuardClausesRule add statement complexity judgment. 'if' is followed directly by a 'return'('throw') statement, the 
complexity of the statement in the 'if' and the complexity of the 'return'('throw') statement will be judged.Only 'if' the 
complexity of the 'return'('throw') statement is less than the complexity of the statement in the 'if' statement will a 
violation be issued.
